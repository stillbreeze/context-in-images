Things to try:

1. Train the network with supercategories instead of categories and then think of bringing in spatial filters
2. Change the architecture; vary number of hidden neurons, go deep, try different activation units and loss functions.
3. Try batch learning for using the complete dataset
4. Think of 'the big idea' to integrate spatial and co-occurence info as an input vector for a CNN
