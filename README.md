Understanding the role of context and global features in object recognition

Dataset used: Microsoft COCO - 90 object categories in real, natural scenes



The way ahead:

1. Extract low level, global feature descriptors like GIST

2. Train using these features and retain contender images

3. Apply semantic features - i) Co-occurence          (Add more)

4. Apply spatial features - i) Relative positioning   (Add more)

5. Apply geometric features- i) Relative size         (OPTIONAL)

6. Model the above features to get top object category suggestions
